  text: `"Virtual reality is evolving beyond gaming into transformative applications. Surgeons practice complex procedures in risk-free simulations, while VR exposure therapy effectively treats phobias and PTSD. Architects walk clients through unbuilt structures, and automotive designers collaborate across continents in shared virtual spaces. Meta's haptic gloves provide realistic touch feedback, and eye-tracking adjusts rendering resolution to reduce motion sickness. The 'metaverse' concept faces skepticism, but enterprise adoption grows steadily—Walmart trains employees using VR at 4,000 locations. Challenges include privacy concerns from biometric data collection and the digital divide excluding those without high-end hardware.

Maintain a light touch on the keyboard, allowing keys to rebound quickly for faster successive strokes."`,
