  text: `"Renewable energy adoption is accelerating globally, with solar and wind now cheaper than fossil fuels in most markets. Floating solar farms on reservoirs and offshore wind turbines with 100-meter blades represent cutting-edge designs. Battery storage capacity must increase twelvefold by 2040 to stabilize intermittent supply, prompting innovations like sand-based thermal storage and hydrogen fuel cells. Developing nations leapfrog coal plants entirely, with Kenya generating 90% of its electricity from geothermal and hydro sources. Challenges include rare earth mineral shortages for turbines and resistance from utility monopolies. Community solar programs allow apartment dwellers to buy into shared arrays, while blockchain enables peer-to-peer energy trading between households. The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates clean power could create 40 million jobs by 2050. As your fingers dance across the keyboard typing these words, consider how each keystroke draws power from this very energy transition. Maintain consistent finger-to-key mapping to build muscle memory efficiently."`,
