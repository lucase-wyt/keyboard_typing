  text: `"Humanity's fascination with space exploration continues driving scientific breakthroughs. NASA's Artemis program aims to return astronauts to the Moon by 2026, establishing a sustainable lunar base. Private companies like SpaceX have reduced launch costs by 90% through reusable rockets, democratizing access to orbit. Meanwhile, the James Webb Space Telescope reveals astonishing details about early galaxies, rewriting astrophysics textbooks. Challenges remain: cosmic radiation threatens crewed Mars missions, and space debris now exceeds 100 million fragments in Earth's orbit. International treaties struggle to keep pace with commercial asteroid mining ventures. Yet collaborations like the International Space Station prove peaceful cooperation is possible. Astrobiologists search for microbial life on Europa's icy moons, while quantum communication experiments enable hack-proof satellite transmissions. As you type this passage, consider how each keystroke connects you to centuries of astronomical discovery—from Galileo's telescope to today's exoplanet catalogs. Maintain steady rhythm and accuracy before pursuing speed."`,
