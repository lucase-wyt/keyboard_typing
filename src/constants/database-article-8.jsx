  text: `"Smart city technologies are redefining urban living. Adaptive traffic lights using real-time data reduce congestion by 30%, while sensor-laden waste bins optimize collection routes. Singapore's virtual power plant integrates thousands of rooftop solar systems into a unified grid. However, concerns persist about surveillance overreach, as seen in China's social credit system. Digital twins—virtual replicas of entire cities—allow planners to simulate disaster responses and infrastructure changes. Barcelona's superblocks initiative reclaims streets from cars, creating pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods with reduced air pollution. Equitable access remains a challenge: 30% of urban populations lack affordable broadband despite 5G rollouts. Typing this text mirrors the data flows that power smart cities—each keystroke a tiny packet contributing to larger understanding. Keep your fingers curved and strike keys with quick, confident motions to maintain flow."`,
