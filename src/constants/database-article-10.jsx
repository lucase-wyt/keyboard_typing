  text: `"Quantum computing promises to revolutionize fields from drug discovery to cryptography. Qubits leveraging superposition can process calculations in minutes that would take classical computers millennia. Google's quantum supremacy experiment in 2019 solved a specific problem in 200 seconds versus 10,000 years. Practical applications include simulating molecular interactions for new materials and optimizing global logistics networks. However, error rates remain high, requiring near-absolute-zero temperatures for stability. The 'Q-Day' threat looms: quantum machines could crack current encryption, prompting NIST to standardize post-quantum cryptography. China's Micius satellite demonstrates quantum communication over 1,200 kilometers using entangled photons. As your fingers type these words, consider how quantum mechanics underpins the very semiconductors in your keyboard. Practice alternating between home row stretches and typing bursts to improve dexterity."`,
